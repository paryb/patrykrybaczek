# Yo! ðŸ¤™ I'm Patryk
I'm a upcoming javascript developer.<br>
Currently working at <a href="https://curbfood.com/">Curbfood</a> to satisfy my passion for cooking. <br>
Having a hard time to accepting something that's "decent", I always strive to improve things and learn more about the unknown. ðŸ˜ƒ
